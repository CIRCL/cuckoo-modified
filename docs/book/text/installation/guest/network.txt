Network Configuration
*********************

Now it's the time to setup the network configuration for your virtual
machine.


Windows Settings
================

Before configuring the underlying networking of the virtual machine,
you might want to trick some settings inside Windows itself.

One of the most important things to do is **disabling** *Windows
Firewall* and the *Automatic Updates*. The reason behind this is that
they can affect the behavior of the malware under normal circumstances
and that they can pollute the network analysis performed by Cuckoo, by
dropping connections or including unrelevant requests.

You can do so from Windows' Control Panel as shown in the picture:

Virtual Networking
==================

Now you need to decide how to make your virtual machine able to access
Internet or your local network.

By default VirtualBox adopts Network Address Translation (NAT) which
in most cases will be good enough for any needs. This is also the
configuration we'll adopt in this documentation.

If you have particular needs and want to use some different
networking, please refer to VirtualBox's virtual networking
documentation.


Network Tracing
===============

Unless you decided to use an external sniffer (as previously discussed
in *Configuration*), you can proceed configuring the network trace
functionality provided by VirtualBox as explained here.

First you need to power off your virtual machine:

   $ VBoxManage controlvm "Name of VM" poweroff

Then you enable network trace:

   $ VBoxManage modifyvm "Name of VM" --nictrace1 on --nictracefile1 /path/to/cuckoo/shares/<VM ID>/dump.pcap

The last argument specifies the path where the PCAP file will be
stored. It has to be an absolute path and include the file name as
well. In order to make Cuckoo able to find the file you'll have to
specify the shared folder you created for current virtual machine and
"*dump.pcap*".
