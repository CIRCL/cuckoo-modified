===============================
Creation of the Virtual Machine
===============================

Once you have :doc:`properly installed <../host/requirements>` VirtualBox you
can proceed on creating all the virtual machines you need.

To do so you can either use the graphical user interface or the powerful
command-line utility *VBoxManage* provided by VirtualBox.

Consider that the use of VirtualBox is not in the purposes of this documentation
so please refer to the `official documentation`_ for it.

.. _official documentation: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html

    .. note::

        You can find some hints and considerations on how to design and create
        your virtualized environment in the :doc:`../../introduction/sandboxing`
        chapter.

    .. note::

        For analysis purposes you are recommended to use Windows XP Service Pack
        3.

When creating the virtual machine, Cuckoo doesn't require any specific
configuration. You can choose the options that best fit your needs.
