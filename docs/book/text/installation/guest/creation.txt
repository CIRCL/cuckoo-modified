Creation of the Virtual Machine
*******************************

Once you have *properly installed* VirtualBox you can proceed on
creating all the virtual machines you need.

To do so you can either use the graphical user interface or the
powerful command-line utility *VBoxManage* provided by VirtualBox.

Consider that the use of VirtualBox is not in the purposes of this
documentation so please refer to the official documentation for it.

   Note: You can find some hints and considerations on how to design and
     create your virtualized environment in the *Sandboxing* chapter.

   Note: For analysis purposes you are recommended to use Windows XP
     Service Pack 3.

When creating the virtual machine, Cuckoo doesn't require any specific
configuration. You can choose the options that best fit your needs.
