Signatures
==========

With Cuckoo you're able to create some customized signatures that you can run against
the analysis results in order to identify some predefined pattern that might
represent a particular malicious behavior or an indicator you're interested in.

Creation of signatures is a very simple process and requires just a decent
understanding of Python programming.

All signatures are and should be located in *modules/signatures/*.
