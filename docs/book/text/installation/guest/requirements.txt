Requirements
************

In order to make Cuckoo run properly in your virtualized Windows
system, you will have to install some required softwares and
libraries.


Install Guest Additions
=======================

VirtualBox's Guest Additions provide some additional functionalities
that allow the host and the guests to interact easily.

They are required for:

   * Time synchronization.

   * Shared folders.

   * Executing processes in the guest.

You can get details on how to install them from the dedicated chapter
in the official documentation.


Install Python
==============

Python is a strict requirement for the Cuckoo guest component
(*analyzer*) to run properly.

You can download the proper Windows installer from the official
website. Also in this case Python 2.7 is preferred.

Some Python libraries are optionals and provide some additional
features to Cuckoo guest component. They include:

   * Python Image Library: it's used for taking screenshots of Windows
     desktop during the analysis.

   * WinAppDbg: it's used by the *tracer package* to dump assembly
     instructions.

They are not strictly required by Cuckoo to work properly, but you are
encouraged to install them if you want to have access to all features
available. Make sure to download and install the proper packages
according to your Python version.


Additional Softwares
====================

At this point you should have installed everything needed by Cuckoo to
run properly.

Depending on what kind of files you want to analyze and what kind of
sandboxed Windows environment you want to run the malwares in, you
might want to install additional softwares such as browsers, PDF
readers, office suites etc. Please remeber to disable the "auto
update" or "check for updates" feature of any additional software.

This is completely up to you and to how you, you might get some hints
by reading the *Sandboxing* chapter.
