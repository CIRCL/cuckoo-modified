Analysis Results
================

Once an analysis is completed, several files are stored in a dedicated directory.
Unless you configured differently, all of the analysis are saved into
*analysis/* with a subdirectory named after the numerical ID assigned to the
analysis into the database.

Following is an example of analysis results::

    .
    |-- analysis.conf
    |-- analysis.log
    |-- dump.pcap
    |-- files
    |   |-- dropped.tmp
    |   `-- dropped.exe
    |-- logs
    |   |-- 1232.csv
    |   |-- 1540.csv
    |   `-- 1118.csv
    |-- reports
    |   |-- report.html
    |   |-- report.json
    |   `-- report.txt
    |-- malware.exe
    |-- shots
    |   |-- shot_1.jpg
    |   |-- shot_2.jpg
    |   |-- shot_3.jpg
    |   `-- shot_4.jpg
    `-- trace

analysis.conf
=============

*analysis.conf* is a configuration file automatically generated by Cuckoo to
specify some parameters to the guest component (analyzer).
It's generally not relevant for an end-users as it's exclusively used internally
by Cuckoo.

analysis.log
============

*analysis.log* is a log file generated by Cuckoo analyzer and that keeps
track of analysis execution and might report errors occurred during the
analysis.

dump.pcap
=========

*dump.pcap* is the trace dump containing all the network activity generated by
the virtual machine during the malware execution.

files/
======

The *files/* directory contains all files created or deleted by the malware and
that were successfully dumped by Cuckoo.

logs/
=====

The *logs/* directory contains the raw CSV-like logs generated by the monitored
processes and that contains the concrete behavioral tracing results.

reports/
========

The *reports/* directory contains the abstract analysis reports generated
automatically by Cuckoo. The number and the format of such reports depends on
the the configuration explained in the :doc:`../installation/host/configuration`
chapter.

shots/
======

The *shots/* directory contains the screenshots of Windows desktop taken during
the analysis execution.

trace/
======

The *trace/* directory is only used in specific cases (for instance when using
the *tracer* analysis package) and contains the assembly instruction traces of
the monitored processes.
