Installing Cuckoo
*****************

Proceed with download and installation.


Create a user
=============

Even if you obviously can run Cuckoo with your current user, creating
a dedicated one is always a good practice.

Create a new user:

   $ sudo adduser cuckoo

Make sure the new user belongs to the "vboxusers" group (or the group
you used to run VirtualBox):

   $ sudo useradd -G vboxusers cuckoo


Download Cuckoo
===============

You can get your copy of Cuckoo from the official website or from our
git repository.

Please notice that the archives to be downloaded from the website are
core releases, while the version on git has to be considered an
**under development** stage, therefore possibly unstable and not yet
fully documented.


Install it
==========

Extract or checkout your copy of Cuckoo to a path of your choice and
you're ready to go ;-).
